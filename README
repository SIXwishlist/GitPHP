About this fork :
=================

This fork was first based on GitPHP v0.2.3 from http://gitphp.org/
It implements all the features of xiphux 0.2.7 and some more fixes from the master branch.

This Variant is made to be compatible with Google 'repo' architecture which is a SCM
layer, based on xml manifest(s), used to manage and sync a lot of git projects.

Due to a massive code rewrite in 0.2.8, i stopped trying to merge xiphux work, which is now very hard to do.
The only way to include all my features in current xiphux variant is to rewrite them from start...

So for the moment, i will only do backports based on the 0.2.7 architecture, named 0.2.7.y

The original skin can be seen here : http://source.gitphp.org/

Another one (blueskin) can be seen here : http://pruvot.tk/gitphp/
